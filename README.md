# Blazon

A script and systemd unit template for setting up `OnFailure=` notifications on any systemd service unit. It currently supports the following notification channels:

1. Desktop via `notify-send` and [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)
1. Slack via [Incoming Webhook](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack)

Pagerduty support is being added "soon"‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## Install the systemd unit template

Automatically:
1. Run `sudo ./install`

Manually:
1. `sudo cp units/* /etc/systemd/system/`
1. `cp bin/blazon /usr/local/bin`
1. Run `systemctl daemon-reload`

## Add Blazon to specific systemd units ‚ú®‚ú®

Add an override for your service on the `blazon@.service` systemd template. In this example we are adding in notifications to [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/). Run `systemctl edit blazon@vault.service` and add these overrides to the new unit.

```bash
[Service]
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_DESKTOP=true
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_SLACK=true
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_PAGERDUTY=true
Environment=BLAZON_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAAAAAAAAAA/BBBBBBBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
```

Next you will add the below to the `vault.service` unit with `systemctl edit vault.service`

```bash
[Unit]
OnFailure=blazon@%N.service
```

Once that is done, reload systemd `systemctl daemon-reload` and tada, you now have notifications on your `vault.service` unit!!üéâ

## Add to all systemd units üì£üì£

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This could be noisy if you have a lot of services. Use at your own risk!

Add `OnFailure=blazon@%N.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/service.d/10-blazon.conf`:

```bash
tee /etc/systemd/system/service.d/10-blazon.conf <<EOF
[Unit]
OnFailure=blazon@%N.service
EOF
```

Prevent ensures that if a blazon@.service instance fails it will not trigger an instance named blazon@blazon.service:

```bash
mkdir /etc/systemd/system/blazon@.service.d/
ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/blazon@.service.d/10-blazon.conf
```

and reload systemd `systemctl daemon-reload`. Now all services will have the `OnFailure=blazon@%N.service` dependency.

## Testing notifications üß™üß™

Install the `blazon-failure-test.service` unit:

```
install -m 0644 units/blazon-failure-test.service /etc/systemd/system
```

Configure blazon to notify when it fails with `systemctl edit blazon@blazon-failure-test.service` and add:

```bash
[Service]
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_DESKTOP=true
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_SLACK=true
Environment=BLAZON_NOTIFY_PAGERDUTY=true
Environment=BLAZON_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAAAAAAAAAA/BBBBBBBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
```

Reload systemd with `systemctl daemon-reload` and start the `blazon-failure-test.service` with `systemctl start blazon-failure-test.service`. This unit will fail on start and notify with Blazon. When you are done testing your notifications, you can run the following to remove it:

```bash
systemctl stop blazon-failure-test.service
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/blazon-failure-test.service
rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/blazon@blazon-failure-test.service.d/
systemctl daemon-reload
```
